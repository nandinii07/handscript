Handwrite makes typing written assignments efficient, convenient and authentic.

Handwrite generates a custom font based on your handwriting sample, which can easily be used in text editors and word processors like Microsoft Word & Libre Office Word!

Handwrite is also helpful for those with dysgraphia.

You can get started with Handwrite [here](https://yashlamba.github.io/handwrite/).

## What you get

1. **A font from your handwriting.** Print a form, fill in one character per
   box, scan it, and `handwrite` turns it into a `.ttf` you can install and
   use in any word processor.

2. **Scientific notation in that handwriting.** `handwrite-render` types
   formulas like `E = mc^2`, `H_2O` and `SO_4^{2-}` in your font, with real
   superscripts and subscripts.

There are two forms. The original `handwrite_sample.pdf` collects 80
characters on one page. The newer `handwrite_sample_extended.pdf` collects
113 across two pages, adding Greek letters, math operators and arrows
(`α β γ δ ε θ λ μ π ρ σ φ ω Δ Ω × ÷ ≠ ≤ ≥ ± ∓ ≈ ∝ ∞ √ → ← ↔ { } | °`) - use
that one if you want to write notation.

## Quick start

```console
pip install handwrite            # also needs potrace and fontforge installed

# Build a font from a single-page form:
handwrite scan.jpg fonts/

# ...or from the two-page extended form (one image per page in a directory):
handwrite scans/ fonts/

# Type notation in it:
handwrite-render --font fonts/MyFont.ttf "E = mc^2" "H_2O" "SO_4^{2-}"
```

The second command writes a self-contained HTML page; print it to PDF from
your browser. Supported notation is `^` and `_`, with `{}` to group more than
one character - see the
[usage guide](https://yashlamba.github.io/handwrite/usage/) for the full
syntax.

## Sample

You just need to fill up a form:

        </img>

Here's the end result!
